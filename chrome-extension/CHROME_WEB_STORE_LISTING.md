**Why Captur is Different:**

Stop wasting time on boring language apps with generic word lists. Learn vocabulary from your favorite YouTubers, tech blogs, hobby content—content you actually enjoy.

Traditional flashcard apps (Anki, Quizlet) require 3-5 minutes of manual card creation per word. Language apps (Duolingo, Babbel) force you through generic lessons instead of letting you learn from content you love.

Captur integrates directly into your browsing experience:
- Hover to translate in 0.5 seconds—no clicking away to dictionaries
- AI automatically identifies difficult vocabulary in articles
- YouTube transcripts let you read while watching and jump to any timestamp
- Clean white card design with 3-tab sticky notes organize takeaways, marked sentences, and your reflections—all auto-saved per page
- Hover over logo button to instantly restore your notes without regenerating (saves time and API calls)
- Lazy-loaded takeaways only generate when you click the Takeaways tab (faster initial load)
- Double-shift AI assistant helps you write better emails and documents
- Multi-language support means you can learn any language from any content

**Not Just Professional Content:**

Learn English from ANY content you love:
- Favorite YouTube creators and channels
- Tech articles and programming blogs
- Business news and industry publications
- Hobby blogs (travel, cooking, sports, gaming)
- Entertainment content and social media
- Topics you're passionate about

Vocabulary matches YOUR interests, not generic textbook lists.
