    "detailedDescription": "Build vocabulary from content you love.\n\nCaptur helps ESL students and professionals build vocabulary naturally—turn your favorite YouTube videos, articles, and blogs into systematic vocabulary learning with zero manual effort.\n\n**How It Works:**\n\n1. **Hover-to-Translate - Zero-Click Vocabulary Lookup**\n   - Select any word or phrase on any webpage\n   - Small teal dot appears at the end of selection\n   - Hover over dot → instant inline translation with styled button\n   - Example: \"opportunities\" becomes **opportunities** _(机会)_\n   - 30x faster than traditional dictionary lookup (0.5s vs 15-20s)\n   - Zero clicks, zero context switching\n\n2. **One-Click Flashcard Save**\n   - Click any vocabulary button (yellow highlight + translation)\n   - Button turns green with ✓ checkmark → word saved to flashcards\n   - Takes 0.5 seconds (600x faster than manual card creation)\n   - Green checkmark prevents duplicate saves\n   - All flashcards sync to captur.academy with spaced repetition\n\n3. **YouTube Transcript with Auto-Generated Vocabulary**\n   - Click \"📝 Key Takeaways\" on any YouTube video\n   - Side-by-side view: video + scrolling transcript\n   - AI auto-detects 10-15 difficult words, highlights them in transcript\n   - Click any highlighted word to save as flashcard\n   - Transcript auto-scrolls with video playback\n\n4. **Auto Vocabulary Extraction from Articles**\n   - Click \"📝 Key Takeaways\" while reading any article\n   - AI identifies 10-15 challenging words based on proficiency level\n   - Words highlighted inline as clickable vocabulary buttons\n   - Each button shows: English word + Chinese translation\n   - Click to save as flashcard with source URL\n\n5. **AI Writing Assistant**\n   - Select text and press Shift twice for instant actions\n   - Voice (rephrase), simplify, or generate replies\n   - Replace text directly in editable fields\n   - Perfect for email writing and professional communication\n\n**Perfect For:**\n\n- ESL students preparing for exams (TOEFL, IELTS, GRE) who consume English content daily\n- International professionals who want to expand vocabulary while reading industry content\n- Language learners building fluency through content they enjoy (YouTube, articles, blogs)\n- Anyone who wants to learn English naturally through favorite creators and topics\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n✓ Hover-to-translate: 30x faster than traditional dictionary (0.5s vs 15-20s)\n✓ One-click flashcard save: 600x faster than manual card creation\n✓ Auto vocabulary extraction with Chinese translations\n✓ YouTube transcript with synchronized vocabulary highlights\n✓ AI-powered key takeaways generation from any content\n✓ Double-Shift quick actions: rephrase, translate, simplify, reply\n✓ Visual vocabulary buttons with yellow highlights\n✓ Green checkmark feedback prevents duplicate saves\n✓ Spaced repetition review system\n✓ Works on YouTube, articles, blogs, social media\n✓ Secure sync with web app at captur.academy\n✓ Privacy-focused—only saves what you select\n\n**Why Captur is Different:**\n\nStop wasting time on boring language apps with generic word lists. Learn vocabulary from your favorite YouTubers, tech blogs, hobby content, topics you're passionate about—content you actually enjoy.\n\nTraditional flashcard apps (Anki, Quizlet) require 3-5 minutes of manual card creation per word. Language apps (Duolingo, Babbel) force you through generic lessons instead of letting you learn from content you love.\n\nCaptur captures vocabulary while you consume content you're already watching and reading. Hover to translate in 0.5 seconds. Click to save. Words appear inline with yellow highlights and translations. Green checkmarks show what's saved.\n\n**Not Just Professional Content:**\n\nLearn English from ANY content you love:\n- Favorite YouTube creators and channels\n- Tech articles and programming blogs\n- Business news and industry publications\n- Hobby blogs (travel, cooking, sports, gaming)\n- Entertainment content and social media\n- Topics you're passionate about\n\nVocabulary matches YOUR interests, not generic textbook lists.\n\nStart building vocabulary from content you love. Try it free.\n\n**Privacy & Data Protection:**\n- **Zero Tracking**: No browsing history, no personal information collection\n- **Explicit Consent Only**: Data collected only when you click \"Save\" or \"Key Takeaways\"\n- **What We Collect**: Selected text, page content (Key Takeaways only), page URL, timestamp\n- **What We DON'T Collect**: Browsing history, keystrokes, passwords, cookies, personal data\n- **AI Features**: Text sent to OpenAI only when you use Key Takeaways/rephrase buttons\n- **OpenAI Policy**: Data not stored for training (per API usage terms)\n- **Your Control**: Delete vocabulary anytime at captur.academy, uninstall extension anytime\n- **Secure**: HTTPS encryption for all data transmission\n- **Transparent**: UI clearly indicates when data will be collected\n- Full privacy policy at captur.academy/privacy\n\n**Support:**\nVisit captur.academy or email support@captur.academy",
